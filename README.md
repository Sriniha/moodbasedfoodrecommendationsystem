### **Project Overview:**  
1. **Developed a Personalized Food Recommendation System**  
   - Built a **mood-based recommendation engine** that suggests food options based on a user’s emotional state.  
   - Implemented a **content-based filtering approach** using mood and food data correlations.  

2. **Integrated Emotion Recognition for Food Selection**  
   - Mapped emotions (happy, sad, stressed, energetic, etc.) to food categories using scientific research and user preferences.  
   - Used **NLP-based sentiment analysis** (if applicable) to infer mood from text inputs.  

3. **Built an Interactive and Adaptive Model**  
   - Designed a system that **learns user preferences over time**, refining recommendations based on feedback.  
   - Incorporated a **user-friendly interface** for seamless experience.  

4. **Used a Diverse Dataset for Better Accuracy**  
   - Collected or processed a dataset containing **mood, food types, nutritional information, and user behavior data** to improve recommendation accuracy.  

### **Project Outcome:**  
✅ **Successfully predicted suitable food options** for different moods with high relevance.
